Disorder-induced transitions in resonantly driven Floquet topological insulators
description2:
Periodically driven system may provide a route for realizing novel phases of matter. Particularly, Floquet topological insulators could be induced by resonantly driving a transition in a spin-orbit coupled quantum well. In this work, disorder, dynamics, and topology are all considered on the same footing within the realm of such phases. First, it is found that Floquet topological phases are robust to disorder. Next, it is found that disorder actually induces a transition into a Floquet topological phase, when the pure driven system is trivial. The resulting driven, disordered, topological phase is a realization of the Floquet topological Anderson insulator.

Duality and universal transport in mixed-dimension electrodynamics
description6:
Using the recently conjectured fermion particle-vortex duality, the authors demonstrate that the theory of a single (2+1)-dimensional Dirac fermion coupled to an Abelian gauge field in a (3+1)-dimensional bulk exhibits a strong-weak duality. The duality is a manifestation of the electromagnetic S-duality in the bulk. At the self-dual point, they find several exact relations between transport coefficients, such as conductivity, Hall conductivity, and thermoelectric coefficients. Consequently, the duality provides new constraints on the physics of a strongly interacting system.

Quantum oscillations in the anomalous spin density wave state of FeAs
description12:
The authors succeeded in growing high-quality crystals of binary FeAs, a spin density wave antiferromagnet with similarities to two families of unconventional superconductors. Quantum oscillations were measured in magnetic torque at high fields, making it possible to compare experimental electronic structure to prior density functional theory calculations. The two agree on the multicarrier nature of FeAs in the magnetic state, but diverge in some aspects of the Fermi-surface geometry. The theoretical results have so far been unable to describe the magnetic structure, and the presented experimental data now indicate that that could be due to an incorrect Fermi surface picture. Oscillations analysis also shows enhanced effective masses compared to theory, indicating that electron correlations may have previously been underappreciated in this material.

Origin of tension-compression asymmetry in ultrafine-grained fcc metals
description13:
Ultrafine-grained Al exhibits remarkable tension/compression asymmetry of yield stress. Large-scale atomistic simulations and dislocation theory reveal that the yield event is not related to intragranular dislocations but caused by dislocation nucleation from the grain boundaries (GBs). Dislocation core associated with the stacking fault energy is strongly affected by the external stress in Al; the dissociation of perfect dislocation is stabilized by high tensile stress. These dislocations are more likely to be nucleated from GBs with lower yield stress. The mechanism, which is completely different from well-known mechanisms for nanocrystalline and amorphous metals, is unique to high-strength UFG metals.

<i>Ab initio</i> dynamical exchange interactions in frustrated antiferromagnets
description17:
The microscopic mechanism of the subpicosecond magnetization dynamics observed in transition metals irradiated by intense optical laser pulses is not yet completely understood. Here, the authors analyze this effect in the case of the frustrated antiferromagnet FeMn within the framework of time-dependent spin-density-functional theory. Detailed spatial and temporal analysis of the first-principles spin dynamics allows an effective fully dynamical nonlocal in space exchange interaction to be introduced and evaluated. The study shows that it is meaningful to distinguish between two types of excitations governing the early dynamics of the antiferromagnetic system. The first type can be described as Stoner-like excitations, while the second type is of a spin-wave nature and is directly related to the ultrafast modification of the effective exchange interaction.

Quantum and frustrated magnets are a great platform to probe collective phenomena of fundamental and technological importance. Antiferromagnets on a diamond lattice have not been as extensively studied as other model magnetic materials due to the absence of obvious geometrical frustration. This is changing with the prediction — and in some cases observation — of several unique phenomena in magnetic A-site spinels like, e.g., degenerate spin spirals, spin-orbital entanglement and topological paramagnetism.

Chirality-mediated bistability and strong frequency downshifting of the gyrotropic resonance of a magnetic vortex due to dynamic destiffening
description24:
The gyrotropic resonance frequency of a magnetic vortex, widely studied for applications in data storage and radio-frequency signal processing, increases with the vortex core’s stiffness. In traditional disk-shaped elements, this stiffness increases if the core is shifted towards the element’s edges. Here, the authors show that introducing a flat edge into a disk locally de-stiffens the core, resulting in the resonant frequency strongly decreasing when the core approaches the element’s flat edge. By controllably displacing the core within the disk one can thus both increase or decrease the core’s resonant frequency with respect to its value when unshifted. This has the effect of more than doubling the accessible range of resonant frequencies. However, more fundamentally, the above properties lead to a chirality-mediated bistability: for a given finite static in-plane magnetic field, one of two values of gyrotropic frequencies can be observed depending on the vortex chirality.

Diagrammatic approach to orbital quantum impurities interacting with a many-particle environment

Feynman diagrams represent one of the most powerful techniques of modern many-particle theory. Applying such diagrammatic techniques to many-body processes involving angular momentum is, however, substantially challenging. Here, the authors introduce a diagrammatic approach to the angulon quasiparticle, which consists of an orbital quantum impurity – such as a molecule or electron – exchanging angular momentum with a bath of bosons (superfluid, lattice phonons). The new approach fuses the Feynman diagrams of solid-state physics with the angular momentum diagrams previously used in atomic and nuclear structure calculations.

Zeeman and spin-orbit effects in the Andreev spectra of nanowire junctions
description29:
Microwave spectroscopy of a Josephson junction is a useful tool to directly measure the properties of Andreev bound states. Recently, this method has been successfully applied to junctions defined in proximitized InAs/Al nanowires whose realization is aimed at the study and use of Majorana zero modes. In these nanowires, Andreev bound states are sensitive to the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and applied magnetic field. Our theory investigates the evolution of the Andreev levels and of the associated microwave spectrum upon application and increase of magnetic field. The authors find that a drastic change in the spectrum occurs once the magnetic field is strong enough to affect the ground-state parity, which can happen before the topological transition. Besides explaining existing experimental data, the presented theory provides guidance for future experiments, involving the spectroscopic observation of the effects associated with Majorana zero modes.

The authors apply a Bayesian model to an extended set of observables calculated for a class of EFT interactions, and demonstrate that a subset of these potentials are consistent with their statistical model for order-by-order convergence.

Simple way to apply nonlocal van der Waals functionals within all-electron methods
description38:
Solid-state simulations at the quantum mechanics level are mostly done by means of density functional theory (DFT). With the development of a new type of functionals about a decade ago, the accuracy of DFT for systems with relevant van der Waals interactions increased. These functionals, the so-called van der Waals functionals, have been used extensively by the pseudopotential solid-state community, but, for technical reasons, not by the community that uses all-electron methods. Here, the authors present a very simple way for the implementation of van der Waals functionals within the framework of all-electron methods. At that, the advantages of the algorithm, used in the pseudopotential methods, are preserved. The development should lead to a much more widespread use of the van der Waals functionals in the all-electron community.

Spin wave propagation in a uniformly biased curved magnonic waveguide
description42:
Using a combination of experiment and simulation, the authors have investigated comprehensively how the spin-wave transmission across a curved magnonic waveguide is modified through rotation of an externally delivered uniform magnetic field. They reveal that, while the spin-wave transmission is reasonable when the bend is magnetized along an axis of symmetry, the transmission can be substantially improved (by a factor of 2) through just rotating the magnetic field by 15° in a particular direction. To explain their results, the authors study the landscape of the internal magnetic field spanning the structure, and discuss how it can be tuned in order to optimally distribute the flow of anisotropic spin waves across networks of magnonic waveguides.

For the experimentally stable interface stoichiometry, there are two distinct interfacial configurations with differing out-of-plane electrical polarizations. The two configurations can be made energetically degenerate by choosing an appropriate top electrode, thus enabling, in principle, an epitaxial ferroelectric thin film oxide. Surprisingly, in the intrinsic limit for Ge, switching the oxide polarization state modulates the band alignments to such a degree that the dominant charge carrier switches between electrons and holes.

Coupling and braiding Majorana bound states in networks defined in proximate two-dimensional electron gases

A key challenge in realizing a Majorana-based topological quantum computer is to identify a scalable platform granting easy control over networks of Majorana bound states. A promising candidate is a two-dimensional electron gas with strong spin-orbit coupling and a superconducting layer on top. Here, the authors propose two different ways of defining Majorana networks in these structures and theoretically model the basic network elements. They show that Majoranas can be exchanged (braided) by controlling their coupling with electric gates.

Symmetric operation of the resonant exchange qubit
description52:
Spin states of a three-electron system can encode one quantum bit in such a way that universal qubit control by voltage pulses becomes possible. In this work, a triple-dot qubit is operated in a highly symmetric charge configuration, using resonant radio-frequency voltage pulses applied to one gate electrode. The authors show that careful symmetrization reduces the susceptibility of the qubit frequency to voltage fluctuations by more than an order of magnitude, compared to conventional triple-dot spin qubits. Combining voltage control with symmetric operating regimes may lead to multiqubit processors based on semiconducting spin qubits that at the same time alleviate decoherence due to electrical noise.

Evaporative purification to produce highly monodisperse polymers: Application to polystyrene for $n=3–13$ and quantification of ${T}_{g}$ from oligomer to polymer
description53:
The polymerization index of polymers is a critical parameter determining many physical properties including solubility and glass transition. Even the most careful chemical synthesis techniques produce a range of polymer sizes. In this paper we show that thermal evaporation, often used to extract dimer and trimer components, can be extended to polymerization indices as high as 13. This new method provides a simple and effective way of producing almost purely monodisperse samples which can in turn be used in tests of the effect of polydispersity on physical properties.

description55:
The fascinating behavior of transition metal oxides can change dramatically when they are scaled down to atomic-size dimensions; however, understanding the emergent properties is a major challenge. In this paper, the authors observe the evolution of multiple phase transitions as the thickness is reduced from bulk to the atomic layer limit in NdNiO<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mrow></mrow><mn>3</mn></msub></math> superlattices. Their measurements demonstrate a separation of the insulating phase from magnetic and charge-ordered phases, which coexist in the bulk, and the emergence of a hidden, unordered insulating phase for a single atomic layer. Modeling shows that the phase manipulation uniquely takes advantage of the effects of 2D confinement and symmetry-breaking at the interface.

Evidence of a fractional quantum Hall nematic phase in a microscopic model
description60:
The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) nematic state is a conjectured state of matter in which FQH topological order coexists with spontaneously broken rotation symmetry. Recent experiments on GaAs quantum wells suggest this state, as well as the concomitant isotropic-nematic phase transition, may be realized in a two-dimensional electron gas at certain rational filling factors. Although effective field theories of the FQH nematic state have been constructed, there has been so far no explicit realization of this state as the ground state of a microscopic model of interacting electrons. The authors show via a variational approach and numerical exact diagonalization that tuning Haldane pseudopotentials in a model of interacting electrons in the lowest Landau level induces a quantum phase transition out of the isotropic Laughlin FQH liquid and into the FQH nematic state.

Electrical Switching of Magnetic Polarity in a Multiferroic ${\mathrm{BiFeO}}_{3}$ Device at Room Temperature

Controlling magnetically polar domains with an electric field, rather than a magnetic field, is a promising route to the next generation of fast, energy-efficient devices for data storage. However, electrical switching of magnetic polarity has been directly observed in bulk single crystals of just a few multiferroics, at low temperatures.

Chirality blockade of Andreev reflection in a magnetic Weyl semimetal
description64:
Conduction electrons in Weyl semimetals move as massless relativistic particles with a definite chirality, meaning that the spin points parallel or antiparallel to the momentum. Such a spin-momentum locking allows for a mechanism to control Cooper-pair transfer at the interface between a magnetic Weyl semimetal and a superconductor. The authors demonstrate that Andreev reflection is fully suppressed when the internal magnetization lies in the plane of the interface. External magnetic field can activate Andreev reflection by relaxing the requirement of zero-spin transfer into the superconductor.

Electronic charge rearrangement at metal/organic interfaces induced by weak van der Waals interactions
description67:
Hybrid metal/organic systems are typically used as models for novel nanoscale interfaces. In particular, the adsorption of molecules on a metal surface implies a rearrangement of electron density, which can be used to modulate the electronic properties of the device. Application of a fully self-consistent Tkatchenko-Scheffler van der Waals density functional demonstrates that these weak interactions can induce large charge rearrangements, leading to nontrivial modifications of interface dipoles, charge transfer phenomena and work functions. Therefore van der Waals interactions should be considered as an additional control parameter in the design of hybrid interfaces with desired electronic properties.

Cheshire charge in (3+1)-dimensional topological phases
description72:
The authors examine the phenomenon of “Cheshire charge” in topological phases of matter in three spatial dimensions. A looplike excitation is said to carry Cheshire charge if the charge is not locally detectable, that is, it can only be observed by a nonlocal process such as shrinking the loop to a point. The authors show that “Cheshire charge” is a generic feature of three-dimensional topological phases. They relate it to other features of these phases, such as three-loop braiding, as well as to higher-category theory that is hypothesized to be the general mathematical framework describing three-dimensional topological phases.

Spectrum of the Wilson-Fisher conformal field theory on the torus

The authors study the finite-size energy spectrum of the O(<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>N</mi></math>) symmetric Wilson-Fisher conformal field theory (CFT) on the spatial torus. They first perform an analytic calculation of the spectrum using the <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>ϵ</mi></math> expansion with a careful treatment of the zero-momentum modes. The authors also perform exact diagonalization on several lattice Hamiltonians whose critical points are known to be described by the Wilson-Fisher CFT. Comparison of the analytic and numerical data demonstrates that the energy spectrum is a useful diagnostic for determining the universality class of a critical point. These results have applications in determining the critical behavior of more complicated many-body systems.

Hall number across a van Hove singularity

The high-field Hall number directly measures the carrier density in metals with closed Fermi surfaces. However, no general theorem is known to govern the behavior of the Hall number in systems with open Fermi surfaces or the critical behavior across a Lifshitz transition from a closed to open topology. Using Boltzmann transport theory, the authors derive analytic expressions for the behavior of the Hall number through such a transition, and recent experiments on hole doped cuprate superconductors that suggest a sudden drop of the Hall number below optimal doping are shown to be consistent with a nematicity-induced Lifshitz transition.

Screened van der Waals correction to density functional theory for solids
description78:
The Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) generalized gradient approximation to the exchange-correlation energy is widely used in materials science. For many solids it somewhat overestimates lattice constants and underestimates cohesive energies. What attraction among the ions is missing in PBE? For ionic solids and heavy metals, a detailed analysis shows that the answer is the van der Waals (vdW) interaction arising from electric charge fluctuations on different ions. Our vdW correction to PBE is a short-range damped and long-range screened pairwise interaction among the ions. We find that the three-body interactions are small due to screening, and that the vdW correction stabilizes the bcc structure of cesium halides over the rocksalt structure.

Effect of SU(2) symmetry on many-body localization and thermalization
description81:
Many-body localization (MBL) enables new nonergodic dynamical phases of matter that avoid the fate of thermalization. Do other ergodicity-breaking phases beyond the MBL paradigm exist? Here, the authors introduce a method for constructing and probing the stability of candidate nonergodic phases. As an example, they consider disordered spin systems, in which a non-Abelian SU(2) symmetry precludes the conventional MBL phase that is characterized by quasilocal integrals of motion and area-law entanglement entropy of eigenstates. Instead, the authors construct a candidate nonergodic phase characterized by eigenstates having logarithmic scaling of entanglement entropy. They find that the phase is only marginally unstable and, therefore, nonthermal yet non-MBL dynamics can be observed in such disordered systems.

Three-dimensional dispersion of spin waves measured in NiO by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering

Nonequilibrium steady states and transient dynamics of conventional superconductors under phonon driving
description94:
The optical manipulation of phonon degrees of freedom can change the effective interactions in solids and potentially enhance superconductivity. However, heating and nonthermal energy distributions need to be considered to understand the ultimate effects of such a driving on ordered states. Using nonequilibrium dynamical mean field theory in the Kadanoff-Baym and Floquet implementation, the authors systematically discuss the effects of parametric phonon driving on conventional superconductivity. Both the transient dynamics of isolated systems and the nonequilibrium steady states in driven-dissipative systems are considered. While the phonon-mediated attractive interaction can be enhanced in certain driving regimes because of Floquet phonon sidebands, the heating and nonthermal distribution effects dominate and generically result in a suppression of superconductivity.

Relativistic theory of magnetic inertia in ultrafast spin dynamics
description99:
In the field of ultrafast spin dynamics, magnetic inertia (spin nutation) is considered to hold great promise for achieving ultrafast magnetization switching. However, the fundamental origin of magnetic inertial dynamics is unknown. Here, the authors derive a complete theory of spin dynamics, including magnetic inertia, from fundamental Dirac theory. They show that magnetic inertia exists for any single Dirac particle and that it is a higher-order relativistic spin-orbit coupling effect compared to Gilbert damping. Magnetic inertia is therefore expected to play a role only on an ultrashort subpicosecond timescale.
